## Paper: Chain of Thought (CoT)
Date read: 1 Nov 2023

### Problem

**Main goal**: Improving outputs from LLMs

Two concepts as baseline:
1. Few shot learning = Give a few examples in the prompt of what it should look like.
2. Arithemtic reasoning = Spell out the logic of thinking of how to solve the problem. 



### Solution
- **CoT**: Combines the two of showing some examples of the thought process. 

### How can it be applied to my current work/reserach
- Give hand holding to the LLM by giving it examples of both reasoning and examples of how it would look in different scenarios.
